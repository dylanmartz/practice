This is a practice repository to learn how to use github.

Look at the 2 tutorials to update path etc...

Steps to add or change files --> can always use git status to look at where I'm at

To add:
1. touch filename   --> This adds an empty file to the folder you are working in
2. git add filename    
3. git commit -m "description of commit"
4. git push

To modify
1. modify the file
2. git add filename
3. git commit -m "description of commit"
4. git push
